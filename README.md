# express_note_taker


## Overview
This application was created to test my ability to use Express to create a server. The server sends files to the client based on the paths it is listening for. Notes are saved to and read from a db.json file. The HTML and CSS portions of the application were provided to me by my instructors at the University of Utah as was the on-click functionality. The backend code is my own. 


## Hosted
This app is hosted courtesy of Heroku. Click [here](https://limitless-sierra-31399.herokuapp.com/) to view the live app. 
* *Notes can be seen by anyone who accesses the application, please be considerate.*
